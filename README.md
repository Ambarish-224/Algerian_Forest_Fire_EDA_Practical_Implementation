Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summaries and graphical representations.

Feature Engineering ( FE ) :- FE is the process of transforming data into features that better represent the underlying problem, resulting in improved Machine Learning Performance.

Topic Covered are:-

1) Understanding the Problem Statement.
2) Data Collection
3) Data Cleaning
4) EDA
    a) Profiling of the Data
    b) Statistical Analysis
    c) Graphical Analysis

5) Feature Engineering
    a) Encoding the Categorical Features
    b) Handling with Null Values
    c) Handling with Outlier.
